## About
- Application that allows students to see homework/assignments assigned to them by their teacher. They will be able to answer the homework questions and submit them before the due date. Teachers will be able to see all assignments they have created, and see all the answers that have been submitted for that question.

## ROADMAP
- Real login/OAuth
- Currently has no way of creating assignments as a teacher, or assigning them. Everything done through backend
- Needs more categories instead of just text-based-answer questions
